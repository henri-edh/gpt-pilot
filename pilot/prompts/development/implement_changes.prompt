I need to modify file `{{ file_name }}` that currently looks like this:
```
{{ file_content }}
```
This file needs to be modified by these instructions:
---------------------start_of_instructions------------------------------
{{ code_changes_description }}
----------------------end_of_instructions-----------------------------
{% if full_output %}
I want you to implement the instructions and show me the COMPLETE NEW VERSION of this file in this format:
-----------------------format----------------------------
```
the full contents of the updated file, without skipping over any content
```

{{ logs_and_error_handling }}

------------------------end_of_format---------------------------
**IMPORTANT**: Your reply should not omit any code in the new implementation or substitute anything with comments like `// .. rest of the code goes here ..`, because I will overwrite the existing file with the content you provide. Output ONLY the content for this file, without additional explanation.
{% else %}
I want you to implement the instructions and show me the exact changes (`diff`) in the file `{{ file_name }}`. Reply only with the modifications (`diff`) in the following format:
-----------------------start_of_format----------------------------
CURRENT_CODE:
```
(All lines of code from specific code block in the current file that will be replaced by the code under NEW_CODE.)
```
NEW_CODE:
```
(All lines of code that will replace the code under CURRENT_CODE. That includes new lines of code and old lines of code that are not being changed but are part of that code block.)
```
END
------------------------end_of_format---------------------------

Once you respond in this format, I will find all occurrences of CURRENT_CODE in the file `{{ file_name }}` and replace them with the code under NEW_CODE.

{{ logs_and_error_handling }}

**IMPORTANT**
Here are rules how to give good response. You have to strictly follow all rules at all times:

Rule #1:
This is most important rule and there must never be reason to break this rule!
When the instructions contain hints such as `# .. insert existing code here ...`, it is imperative to interpret and insert the relevant code from the original. Never omit any code that belongs in the new block, and never replace any code with comments such as `// the rest of the code goes here`, '# existing code from another file', or similar, even if the instructions explicitly request it!
If the instruction examples reference existing code to be pasted in place, always use the specified code from the previous messages in this conversation instead of copying the comment, as illustrated in the following example:
------------------------start_of_example_1---------------------------
Instructions: "Rename function increase() { // ... existing code } to function inc() { // ... existing code } and increase counter by 10 instead of 1."
------------------------BAD response for example_1:---------------------------
CURRENT_CODE:
```
function increase() {
   // ... existing code
}
```
NEW_CODE:
```
function inc() {
   // ... existing code
  return value + 10;
}
```
------------------------GOOD response for example_1:---------------------------

CURRENT_CODE:
```
function increase(value) {
  if (typeof value !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('Argument must be number');
  }
  return value + 1;
}
```
NEW_CODE:
```
function inc(value) {
  if (typeof value !== 'number') {
    throw new Error('Argument must be number');
  }
  return value + 10;
}
END
```
------------------------end_of_example_1---------------------------

Rule #2:
For each change that needs to be done, you must show exactly one CURRENT_CODE code block and one NEW_CODE code block. You can think of this as difference (`diff`) between the current implementation and the new implementation.
If there are no lines of code that need to be replaced by the NEW_CODE (if the NEW_CODE needs to be added into the CURRENT_CODE), show a couple of lines of code in the CURRENT_CODE before the place where NEW_CODE needs to be added.
Here is an example of how to add one line `i--;` in the for loop:
------------------------start_of_example_2---------------------------
CURRENT_CODE:
```
let i = 0;
i++;
for (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
```
NEW_CODE:
```
let i = 0;
i++;
for (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
    i--;
```
END
------------------------end_of_example_2---------------------------

Here's an example how to add code to the beginning of the file:
------------------------start_of_example_3---------------------------
CURRENT_CODE:
```
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
```
NEW_CODE:
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
```
END
------------------------end_of_example_3---------------------------

Rule #3:
Do not show the entire file under CURRENT_CODE and NEW_CODE but only the lines that need to be replaced. If any lines should be left as they are in CURRENT_CODE, do not write them.

Rule #4:
You must output the CURRENT_CODE exactly as it is in the original file, including the indentation from the original code, as it will be used for search-replace, and it should only match the original file in ONE place.
In the NEW_CODE, remember to follow the same coding style that is used in the rest of the file. Pay special attention to the indentation of the new code and make sure to include all the required old and new code, without omitting anything.
Pay very close attention to parenthesis and make sure that when CURRENT_CODE is replaced with NEW_CODE there are no extra parenthesis or any parenthesis missing.

Rule #5:
Pay attention to the lines of code that you select in the CURRENT_CODE and the lines that you add to NEW_CODE because all lines under CURRENT_CODE will be replaced with the lines under NEW_CODE. Sometimes you might duplicate the currently implemented lines by not putting them under CURRENT_CODE but repeating them under NEW_CODE - you must **NOT** do that.
Here is an example. Let's say that you have a code like this:
```
let someClass = new SomeClass();
let methodValue = someClass.someMethod();
```
And you want to add a line `methodValue += 22;` below the line `let methodValue = someClass.someMethod();`. Here is an example of what you must **NOT** do:
------------------------start_of_incorrect_example---------------------------
CURRENT_CODE:
```
let methodValue = someClass.someMethod()
```
NEW_CODE:
```
let someClass = new SomeClass();
let methodValue = someClass.someMethod();
methodValue += 22;
```
END
------------------------end_of_incorrect_example---------------------------

See how the line `let someClass = new SomeClass();` was added under NEW_CODE but it wasn't mentioned under CURRENT_CODE so the result will be that this line will be duplicated in the end result once the line `let methodValue = someClass.someMethod()` gets replaced with lines under NEW_CODE. Instead, this would be a correct way to do it:
------------------------start_of_correct_example---------------------------
CURRENT_CODE:
```
let methodValue = someClass.someMethod()
```
NEW_CODE:
```
let methodValue = someClass.someMethod();
methodValue += 22;
```
END
------------------------end_of_correct_example---------------------------
